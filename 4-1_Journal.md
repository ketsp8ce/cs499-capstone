## Part One

### Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this change? If not, why have you remained with your original plan?
  I have indeed changed my career plans. When I first chose to commit to SNHU's computer science program, I had previously desired to major in molecular biology.
  I wanted to work in bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, pharamcology research or some related field, however I did not want to work in a lab setting.
  I thought that gaining a background in computer science would allow me to work in one of these fields from a theoretical angle such as writing software.
  Throughout my time in the computer science program, however, I fell in love with many other subjects within tech.
  Now I am not set on working in a biotech adjacent field and would be happy working in IT, cybersecurity, and numerous other areas of tech.
### How has your thinking about your career evolved?
  I originally wanted to work in something biotech adjacent due to my long standing interest in molecular biology and pharmacology. However, I have also had a long standing interest in tech and computer science. I tried and failed to learn to code several times in middle school and high school, but I always felt as though I could excel in these areas with proper guidance and structure. 
  My interest in bio/pharm was at least in part influenced by my own health issues mixed with health anxiety, and there was a neurotic component to wanting to understand things personally to escape the fear of not understanding my own body or my own pain. 
  I eventually decided that pursuring a career based on a passion rooted in health anxiety was not ultimately a psychologically healthy choice for me.
  In contast, my interest in technology has always been purely conceptual and something that I could encourage and engage with wihtout obsession.  
### Have you completed any research about your choice of career? How has this impacted your thinking? Have you thought about seeking an advanced degree or certification after earning your undergraduate degree? ###
I have indeed conducted research in various areas of the technolgoy field. Reading article,s watching videos, consulting with career counselors to name a few. In tandem with completed more courses and learning the fundamentals of various areas of computer science, I have realized that information technology encompasses most of my interests. I have been studying for the comptia security+ and network+. Once I complete, my degree I will choose one of these to commit to studying. However, I have also reamined open to various other types of jobsnand internships such as software engineering and AI. The job market is tough right now, so I will take whatever I can get. 
I have considered 
### Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones remain?
In my first enhancmenet for artifact 1, I wrote in my enhancement plan that the following course outcome would dbe met: 
 ** "Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. ” **
I believe I succeeded in meeting this outcome by writing a conventionally professional tutorial and implementing a version control process.
For my second enhancement, I proposed the following course outcome would be met:
 ** "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices." **
I succeeded in meeting this outcome by reconstructing an OpenGL 3D model in Unity, which has data structures and algorithms underlying its architecture.
I have yet to employ the following course outcome, but plan to in my third artifact:
** “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.” **
I will need to construct a client server environment for my third artifact enhancement, which will recreate the environment used in my client server development course. I will need to host the server with a database and the client side environment to query the database. I will also need to reconstruct the CRUD module.
The course outcome which I proposed would align with artifact 3 in my enhancement plan
** "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals." **
While artifact 3 will still encompass this, I believe that the first two artifacts also fell under this outcome. 

## Part Two 

### Provide an update to your instructor on your progress with each category of artifacts for the ePortfolio:

    **Software design and engineering**
I have completed the majority of a tutorial on Linux Virtualization for beginners. I have completed the Arch Linux component of this tutorial, and I plan to add a Kali Linux and Debian component either during the remainder of my time enrolled in cs499, or sometime following the completion of the course.
    **Algorithms and data structures**
I have completed a 3D model of the same frilled shark plushie in Unity, which I originally constructed in openGl. I plan to add lighting and possibly a background in the future. 
    **Databases**
I have yet to begin my third artifact, which will consist of recreating a client server development environment on my own system.
