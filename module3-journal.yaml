Part One:

    How might you use an ePortfolio for the benefit of self-promotion?
    How might you mitigate risks while maximizing the marketing potential of the ePortfolio?
    Describe possible downsides or risksâ€”for instance, the risks of posting intellectual property online for public consumption.
    Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones remain?

Part Two:

Provide an update to your instructor on your progress with each category of artifacts for the ePortfolio:

    Software design and engineering
    Algorithms and data structures
    Databases

Use the following Status Checkpoints table to document your progress in each of your three category enhancements. Complete the table with a report on each category, including its status and some details. For instance, if you are working on the initial enhancement for your work in the databases category, you would briefly note which enhancements you have completed and which are still to come in that cell of the table. Also, note any trouble spots or places where you may need help. A sample exemplar can be found in the Reading and Resources section of the course.
