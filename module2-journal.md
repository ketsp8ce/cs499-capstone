# Part 1

**What is code review**  
A code review is a process of peer developers systematically inspecting anothers code, or their own code from some time ago, for quality prior to the date of release.  
**Why is it an important practice for computer science professionals**
A brand new or fresh pair of eyes often catches mistakes, errors, or inefficient structure that would be missed when one examines the same code for a long period.  
**What are some code review best practices that you read about in the resources that are crucial to include in a code review?**  
Limit review session length to 60 minutes; Add annotations to the code prior to conducting the review; Use checklists to guide the review process, especially to highlight each feature that the code may be missing.
**Include when a code review should occur in the development process with a rationale as to why.** 
 In general, a code review should occur between iterations of the project, such as when before a new branch is created, but before anything is merged to the main branch or published.

# Part 2
**What software have you chosen to use to record your code review?**  
I will be use ScreenPal to conduct my code review.
**Describe your approach to creating an outline or writing a script for your code review for each of the three categories that you will be reviewing based on the rubric as well as the code review checklist.**  
Since the code reivew is informal, I am planning to go off of the checklist and speak in the moment. The main reason is that if I am read off of a script, this may not translate well within the time limit. I also believe due to the nature of the assignment that the review process will be more authentice if I do not write a script in advance.
